An autoscript to setup xray server to run vmess/vless/trojan to bypass certain restrictions.

Silk Road will help you manage your users (clients) through terminal. Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with Command Line Interface (CLI) because Silk Road will guide you through the on-screen instructions as easy as 1,2,3.

Not only that, Silk Road enables you to check multilogin users so that you can block their IDs. It also enables you to block unwanted url such as porn/torrent/ads/malware/phishing and many more by integrating [Helium app](https://github.com/abidarwish/helium).
