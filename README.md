# Silk Road
An autoscript to setup xray server to run vmess/vless/trojan to bypass certain restriction.

Silk Road will help you manage their users (clients) through terminal. Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with Command Line Interface (CLI) because Silk Road will guide you through the on-screen instruction as easy as 1,2,3.

Not only that, Silk Road enables you to check multilogin users so that you can block their IDs. It also enables you to block unwanted url such as ads/malware/phishing/porn/torrent and many more by integrating Helium app.

Requirement: Debian/Ubuntu VPS.

Silk Road is free of charge but if you need technical support and show your appreciation for my work, please contact:
