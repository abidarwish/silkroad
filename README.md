Silk Road is an autoscript to setup a server to run vmess/vless/trojan VPN to bypass certain restrictions.

### Speedup Internet Connection

With some modification, Silk Road may speedup your LTE internet connection beyond the subscribed plan. Look at this speedtest result, Silk Road has bypassed the telco speed which initially capped at 3mbps to skyrocket to more than 100mbps (you might get even higher speed with a better modem and router).

### Prevent Multilogin ID

Not only that, Silk Road enables you to check multilogin users so that you can block their IDs.

### Protect You and Your Loved Ones From Malwares

It also enables you to block unwanted url such as porn, torrent, ads, malware, phishing and many more by integrating [Helium app](https://github.com/abidarwish/helium).

Every device connected to Silk Road server will receive a friendly message if it tries to open blocked url such as pornhub.com like the photo below. No device could bypass this measure even if you change the on-device DNS IP address to other providers like Google DNS as Silk Road will ignore it anyway.
